## Section 1

Icelandair offers a unique transatlantic experience that turns your journey into part of the adventure: on select routes like London Heathrow (LHR) to Seattle (SEA), you can enjoy a discounted fare that includes a stopover in Reykjavik at no additional airfare, letting you break up the trip with a short Icelandic getaway. This stopover program, promoted in partnership with Iceland’s national tourism efforts, is designed to encourage travelers to explore Iceland’s dramatic landscapes, culture, and cuisine for a few days before continuing on to North America—effectively giving you a mini vacation in Iceland built seamlessly into your long-haul flight.
