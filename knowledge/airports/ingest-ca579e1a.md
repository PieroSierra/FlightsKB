## Section 1

London Heathrow (LHR) has four passenger terminals in operation—Terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5—each broadly organised by airline alliances and major carriers. Terminal 2, known as The Queen’s Terminal, is home to Star Alliance airlines, including Lufthansa, United, Air Canada and Singapore Airlines. Terminal 3 hosts a mix of long-haul carriers, notably oneworld members such as American Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, alongside Virgin Atlantic and several other international airlines. Terminal 4 is primarily used by SkyTeam airlines—including Air France, KLM and Delta—as well as a number of Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Terminal 5 is operated almost exclusively by British Airways, with Iberia Express and a small number of partner flights also based there, making it the largest single-airline terminal at the airport.
