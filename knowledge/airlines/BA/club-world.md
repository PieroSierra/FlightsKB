## Club World Overview

**Claim type:** fact
**Applies to:** airline=BA, cabin=business
**Summary:** BA's long-haul business class product with lie-flat beds and direct aisle access on newer aircraft.

British Airways Club World is the carrier's long-haul business class product. The newest Club Suites, found on A350 and refurbished 777s, offer doors for privacy, 40 inches of legroom, and direct aisle access from every seat.

## Seat Selection Tips

**Claim type:** tactic
**Applies to:** airline=BA, cabin=business
**Summary:** Row 1 and window seats in Club Suites offer the most privacy.

For Club Suites configuration, window seats provide the most privacy as the door closes fully. Row 1 seats have extra legroom but are near the galley. On the A350, seats 11A and 11K are considered the best in the cabin.
