## Overall Impression

**Rating:** 4.5/5
**Summary:** Excellent hard product with doors, comfortable bed, but catering could improve.

The BA Club Suite on the A350 represents a significant upgrade from the old Club World seat. The suite door provides genuine privacy and the bed is one of the most comfortable in the sky.

## Highlights

- Full privacy door that closes completely
- 18.5-inch 4K screen with good entertainment selection
- Very comfortable mattress pad and bedding
- Direct aisle access from every seat

## Areas for Improvement

- Catering remains behind competitors like Qatar and Singapore
- Champagne selection is adequate but not exceptional
- WiFi pricing is steep compared to US carriers
