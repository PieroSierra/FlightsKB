## Overall Impression

**Rating:** 4/5
**Summary:** Modern, efficient terminal with excellent lounge options but can get crowded at peak times.

Terminal 5 is BA's dedicated home at Heathrow and shows. The architecture is impressive, navigation is straightforward, and lounge options are plentiful for premium passengers.

## Highlights

- Excellent Galleries Club and Galleries First lounges
- Efficient security with Fast Track lanes
- Good retail and dining options
- Smooth connections to T5B and T5C via transit

## Areas for Improvement

- Gets very crowded during morning rush (6-10 AM)
- Limited seating in main departure area
- Some gates require long walks or additional bus rides
